# RT11
CP/M program to transfer files to/from RT-11 RX01 formatted 8-inch floppies

Source-code is written in a variant of C to be compiled using
BDS-C v1.46 (later versions may work too).

I use this to copy files from RT-11 formatted Single Density and
Single Sided RX01 eight-inch floppy disks on my CompuPro/Godbout
S-100 bus Z80 system with a DISK-1 floppy controller.

I think the original source came on one of the BDS-C User Group disks
and submitted into the public domain by William C. Colley, III in
March 1981.
